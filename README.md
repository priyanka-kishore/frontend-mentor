## FrontendMentor.io Challenge Roadmaps

### Getting Started on FrontendMentor (beginner)

These projects will help you get started on the Frontend Mentor platform and give you experience working with designs and building small projects. They're all HTML & CSS-only challenges, so they'll help you learn the basics.

- [x] 1. QR code component (ðŸ†“)
- [x] 2. 3-column preview card component (ðŸ†“)
- [ ] 3. Single price grid component (ðŸ†“)
- [ ] 4. Order summary component (ðŸ†“)
- [ ] 5. Stats preview card component (ðŸ†“)

### Building Responsive Layouts (beginner)

A crucial part of modern front-end development is making web pages look good on various device sizes. We provide designs at 375px, 768px (premium challenges), and 1440px. Designers often use these sizes when designing layouts. However, as a developer, you must ensure layouts look good at all screen sizes. So be sure to test your projects on many device sizes. Tools like [Responsively](https://discord.com/channels/824970620529279006/1131865518618460210/1132431845573804042) can help you do this.

We recommend you build these projects [mobile-first](https://discord.com/channels/824970620529279006/1131865518618460210/1132431845573804042). Working mobile-first means you will start with the mobile layout and adjust for larger screens. It's a typical workflow with professional front-end developers, so worth trying out and getting some practice.

### JavaScript fundamentals (beginner)

These projects will help you find your feet using JavaScript to add interactivity to your web pages. While working through this roadmap, you'll practice concepts such as:

- Variables
- Working with different data types
- DOM manipulation
- Events
- Conditionals
- Working with data (JSON and APIs)
- And more!

Try completing these challenges using vanilla JavaScript to help build a solid base. No libraries or frameworks for now! ðŸ™‚

- [ ] 1. Ping single column coming soon page (ðŸ†“)
- [ ] 2. Interactive rating component (ðŸ†“)

- [ ] 7. Tip calculator app (ðŸ†“)

### Intro to JavaScript frameworks (beginner - intermediate)

This roadmap provides a guided sequence of projects to help you start practicing with JS frameworks. While working through these projects, you'll practice concepts like:

- Basic JavaScript syntax
- DOM Manipulation
- Component-based architecture
- Data Binding
- Routing and navigation
- State management
- Working with data (JSON and APIs)
- Build and deployment

**Prerequisites**: We recommend a strong understanding of JavaScript fundamentals before learning JavaScript frameworks. Understanding core JS concepts will ensure you grasp the underlying concepts that frameworks help abstract.

- [ ] 9. Dictionary web app (ðŸ’°)

### Intro to accessibility (beginner)

Accessibility spans all front-end languages and impacts how usable sites you create are to everyone who visits. Deep knowledge in this area will help you build better projects and is crucial to becoming a professional developer.

The challenges in this roadmap will help you practice the following concepts:

- Semantic HTML
- Keyboard navigation
- Focus management
- Multimedia and alternative text
- ARIA roles and attributes
- Accessible forms
- Responsive design
- Testing for accessibility

While building each project, test for [keyboard accessibility](https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/) and use tools like [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/) and [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/) to run automated tests. Automated testing can only go so far, though. Go through [manual accessibility tests](https://web.dev/learn/accessibility/test-manual/) to ensure you test each project comprehensively. Going through this process will give you an excellent grounding in the workflow of a professional developer.

**Prerequisites**: Because accessibility spans HTML, CSS, and JS, we recommend you understand each language's fundamentals before working through this roadmap.

We also recommend reading through the ["Learn Accessibility!" tutorial on web.dev](https://web.dev/learn/accessibility/) to give you a solid grounding in accessibility fundamentals.
